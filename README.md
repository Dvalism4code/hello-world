# hello-world
this is my first github repo.
my name is ken Izibenikien, am a Nigerian and am currently learning the basics of web development
My journery of web development kick start through the Google Africa Scholarships, i was selected as part of the scholars to learn mobile web development. the learning platform for the scheme was pluralsight,their courses were great because what the teach is the latest in the tech field. i was exposed to online meet ups and local meet ups. its was a lot of fun for me as beginner because i met with colleagues that has been in the field for long.
After about a month of vigorous study we all where introduced to debuging and putting what we have learnt into use the CHALLENGE which was to build a paycard. i struggled with the challenge because by then i was just through with the basic html5 and haven't learnt CSS so i couldn't complete the challenge befor the deadline. to cut the long story short i didn't make it to the phase two of the program,but i never stop learning now i can find my way around CSS and about diving into learning javascript. and i have a lot of projects i will to build to create a portfolio which i can present to my future employers.
